# Introduction to the quantum theory of fields

## Invariance principle
- Einstein:
  Invariance determines physics laws.
- Theory of relativity:
  invariant under relativistic transformations,
  e.g.~spacetime translations, and the Lorentz transformations
- Equations in the relativistic theory are categorised by a quantity called 'spin'.
  - 0: Klein-Gordon
  - 1/2: Dirac
  - 1: Maxwell
  - 3/2: Rarita-Schwinger

## Theory of relativity was waiting for the quantisation?
- We apply 'the first quantisation',
  $$
  E \mapsto i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t},
  \quad
  p \mapsto -i\hbar \nabla,
  $$
  to Einstein's relation,
  $$
  E^2 - p^2 c^2 - m^2 c^4 = 0,
  $$
  to obtain the Klein-Gordon equation,
  $$
  \Big[
  -\frac{1}{c\^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} 
  -\nabla^2 - \left(\frac{mc}{\hbar}\right)^2 = 0,
  \Big]
  $$
- classical interpretation of the KG equation is impossible due to the presence of $\hbar$ except when $m=0$.
